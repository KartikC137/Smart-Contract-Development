## [NFTs (ERC-721 Token standard)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/)

- Basically ERC20 tokens, but each token is unique

## Working with SVG

- use command `base64 -i path_to_svg` to get a hash
- To tell the browser its a svg, we can do `data:image/svg+xml;base64,SVG_HASH`, where SVG_HASH is the hash you got from above
